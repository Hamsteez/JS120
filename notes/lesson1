- OOP:
  programming paradigm, where we think about a problem in terms of objects
  collection of objects that interact with each other
- Encapsulation:
  combining data and the operations related to that data into one entity
  bundling state (data) and behavior (operations) to form a single object

when object properties have functions, we call it a method.

collaborator objects or collaborators is something that helps an object reference another object
